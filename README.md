# React icons
[react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)


# The purpose of this project
1) Creating a profile.
2) Practicing React and becoming familiar with it.
3) Creating my own component library instead of using existing ones for practice.
4) Exploring and applying new dependencies that I am not yet familiar with.

# Memoir

## SVG icons
When implementing the VS Code theme profile, the first challenge was working with icons.

<b>First attempt</b>: I tried using .gif or .png icons. However, the issue was that I couldn't change the icon's colour in response to events like hover, focus, or active.

<b>Second attempt</b>: I added icons to data object files by copying SVG code from Font Awesome and pasting it into `COMPONENT_NAME.js` in the `src/data` folder to import SVG files as needed. Unfortunately, many of the required icons were missing for the VS Code theme in Font Awesome.

<b>Third attempt</b>: I tried using Fantasticon, referring to the [vscode-codicons](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons?tab=readme-ov-file). However, after installing the dependency as instructed, I couldn't see any folder icons or templates in my project.

<b>Fourth attempt</b>: Finally, I used [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/), which allowed me to access icons from various platforms. With this, I successfully added the default VS icons to my project.


## JSX element compie
I initially thought I could dynamically add components by passing them to a customized component. However, the JSX compiler didn't create the expected component when I passed the components as props. This is because JSX compiles differently depending on whether the first letter of a component's name is lowercase or uppercase.
- `<component />` compiles to `React.createElement('component')` (html tag)
- `<Component />` compiles to `React.createElement(Component)`   (Component)
- `<obj.component />` compiles to `React.createElement(obj.component)` (html tag)

> [!NOTE] Ref: ref: [User-Defined Components Must Be Capitalized](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#user-defined-components-must-be-capitalized)

I need this for my icons. I added icons to the side menu, and these icons need to be passed to the `ActivityBar` component. However, when passing them through props in React, the tags were converted to lowercase. 
  
<b>First attempt</b>: I had to rename the object by creating `CapitalizedComponent` in `common.js` to ensure the component names remained capitalized. However, it was quite inconvenient, and the component name didnâ€™t accurately reflect its purpose, as it was only meant for icons.

```JavaScript
// common.js
export const CapitalizedComponent = ( props ) => {
  let Component = Components[ props.type ];
  return (<Component { ...props } />);
}
```

<b>Second attempt</b>: I created an `Icon` component that contains the icon component along with default styles like color and size. When a matching icon is found based on the passed name, it creates the component and returns it to the caller.

```JavaScript
// Icon.js
export const Icon = ({ name, className = '',  ...props }) => {
  const iconData = iconMap[name.toLowerCase()];

  if (!iconData) {
    console.warn(`Icon not found: ${name}`);
    return <span>`Icon not found: ${name}`</span>;
  }

  const { component: IconComponent, style } = iconData;

  const combinedStyle = {
    ...style,
    ...props.style,
  };

  return <IconComponent style={combinedStyle} {...props} className={`${className}`.trim()} />;
};
```

## Compound Component Pattern
Creating a parent component which has children compont and access the children from the parent component like Bootstrap like the following the example.
`HTML
<EditorArea>
  <EditorArea.Header>
    <EditorArea.Tab></EditorArea.Tab>
    <EditorArea.Tab></EditorArea.Tab>
  </EditorArea.Header>

  <EditorArea.Body>
    <EditorArea.Title></EditorArea.Title>
    <EditorArea.SubTitle></EditorArea.SubTitle>
  </EditorArea.Body>
</EditorArea>
`

### What is the 'Compound Component Pattern'?
Compound components are a React pattern that provides an expressive and flexible way for a parent component to communicate with its children, while expressively separating logic and UI.


## Props Type Settings
I am not using TypeScript and wanted to prevent unexpected type errors, similar to other popular libraries, so I decided to use the `prop-types` library in my custom components.

```
npm install --save prop-types
```
